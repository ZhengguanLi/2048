## 2048 Game 
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 
However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
